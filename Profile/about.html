        Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.<br><br>She looks like one. Where'd you get the coconuts? Shut up! Well, I got better. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system! On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.<br><br>Well, she turned me into a newt.  No, no, no!  Yes, yes.  A bit.  But she's got a wart.  Found them?  In Mercia?! <strong> The coconut's tropical!</strong> <em> Camelot!</em>  Well, what do you want?<br><br>Who's that then?<br><br>I have to push the pram a lot. Now, look here, my good man. The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.<br><br>We want a shrubbery!!<br><br>Well, we did do the nose.<br><br>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one.<br><br>I am your king.<br><br>Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! I am your king. I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time!<br><br>The nose?<br><br>Burn her anyway!<br><br>On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.<br><br>Burn her! Bring her forward! She looks like one. It's only a model. And the hat. She's a witch!<br><br>And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, I got better. The Knights Who Say Ni demand a sacrifice! Burn her anyway! â€¦Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?<br><br>You don't vote for kings. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Who's that then? Why do you think that she is a witch? Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

      <p>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!<br><br>I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!<br><br>I'm not a witch. <em><strong>Well, I got better.</strong>The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. You don't vote for kings.</em></p>
